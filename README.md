## Annie's Website
This is a website acts as a living resume that provides an overview of my experiences, and showcases my technical experience working with computer applications as an undergraduate kinesiology student. It includes an archive of all the projects I have worked on so far, which includes works related to coding, data processing and data analysis. This website will be updated regularly.
