					<h4>Plotting FECO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> over VO<sub>2</sub> for Subject 1432</h4>
					<p> This graph visually represents the relationship between FECO<sub>2</sub> and VCO<sub>2</sub> against VO<sub>2</sub>. Values for the gas exchange threshold (GET) and respiratory compensation point (RCP) were also established. To gain access to the line of code used to develop this plot <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/anniemach/knes381-website"><span style="color: #00BFFF;"> CLICK HERE! </span></a></p>
					<h4>Using Python for Data Processing and Data Analysis</h4>
					<p>Python can be particulary useful in the field of kinesiology, as it is widely used for data processing and data analysis. For instance, Python can extract meaningful data from large data sets to aid in creation of graphs.Despite Excel being the more common and popular method to create graphs, I find that Python is is also a convenient and efficeint way to process large sets of data. Therefore, I intend to further develop my Python coding skills in the future. </p>

						<h3><strong><span style="color: #00BFFF;">USING DARTFISH FOR VIDEO ANALYSIS</span></strong></h3>

					<p>Dartfish is an application that allows for video analysis of sports performance. It's highly useful as it allows coaches to provide direct real-time feedback to athletes about their technique and form.</p>
					<p> In the video above, I have performed a video analysis of an individual's long jump performance. I broke down his performance into six key snapshots:</p>
					<p><strong>Takeoff Phase:</strong> The first and second snapshot showed the initiation and execution of his takeoff. His technique was appropriate as he kept an erect posture, with a slight vertical head tilt as he was preparing to take off.</p>

					<p><strong>Flight Phase:</strong> The third, forth and fifth snapshot show him using the hitch-kick technique during the flight phase. He maintained a slight vertical head tilt, and his arms were swinging in a controlled manner, pulling his arms overtop his head prior to landing. </p>
					<p><strong>Landing Phase:</strong> The sixth snapshot showcases his landing. He was able to land with his heels hitting the sand first, which is an appropriate technique. </p>

						<h3><strong><span style="color: #00BFFF;">USING GIMP FOR PHOTO EDITING</span></strong></h3>
					</header>
					<img src="images/gimpphoto.png" alt="python graph" width="600" height="525"/>
					<p> GIMP is a versatile photo editing application. The above image is a collage I created through the use of fundamental editing techniques. These techniques include the cropping and resizing of photos, the use of color correction, and the seamless overlay of multiple images. </p>

					<p>Scratch is a useful tool to learn the fundamental programming concepts. The concepts learned are transferable to other programming languages like Python. Therefore, grasping the fundamental programming concepts in Scratch, can aid in seamless transition to other traditional programming languages.</p>

<p> I created a multi-level maze game that includes a personalized sprite and a countdown timer, among other features. <span style="color: #00BFFF;"> Try out the game for yourself!</span></p>
