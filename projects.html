					<p>Python can be particulary useful in the field of kinesiology, as it is widely used for data processing and data analysis. For instance, Python can extract meaningful data from large data sets to aid in creation of graphs. </p>
					<p> Despite Excel being the more common and popular method to create graphs, I have recently starting using Python, as it is highly efficient and easy to use. The image above is a graph I created that plots the relationship between FECO2 and VCO2 against VO2. These are two separate graphs that are stacked on top of each other. </p>

					<p>Dartfish is an application that allows for video analysis of sports performance. It's highly useful as it allows coaches to provide direct real-time feedback to athletes about their technique and form. While I was using this application, I found it to be very beginner friendly. </p>
					<p> In the video above, I have performed a video anlysis of an individual's long jump performance. I broke down his performance into six key snapshots. The first and second snapshot shows the initiation and execution of the takeoff phase. The third, forth and fifth snapshot show him in the air. And lastly the sixth snapshots shows his landing. 
<p> I hope to continue building upon my skills and </p>

					<p>Scratch is a useful tool to learn the basics of coding. I created a multi-level maze game that includes a personalized sprite and a countdown timer, among other features. Try out the game for yourself!  </p>
